ABSTRACT = {In the past few decades, metaheuristics have demonstrated their suitability in addressing complex problems over different domains. This success drives the scientific community towards the definition of new and better-performing heuristics and results in an increased interest in this research field. Nevertheless, new studies have been focused on developing new algorithms without providing consolidation of the existing knowledge. Furthermore, the absence of rigor and formalism to classify, design, and develop combinatorial optimization problems and metaheuristics represents a challenge to the field’s progress. This study discusses the main concepts and challenges in this area and proposes a formalism to classify, design, and code combinatorial optimization problems and metaheuristics. We believe these contributions may support the progress of the field and increase the maturity of metaheuristics as problem solvers analogous to other machine learning algorithms.},

abstract="Genetic Algorithms are heuristic search approaches that are applicable to a wide range of optimization problems. This flexibility makes them attractive for many optimization problems in practice. Evolution is the basis of Genetic Algorithms. The current variety and success of species is a good reason for believing in the power of evolution. Species are able to adapt to their environment. They have developed to complex structures that allow the survival in different kinds of environments. Mating and getting offspring to evolve belong to the main principles of the success of evolution. These are good reasons for adapting evolutionary principles to solving optimization problems.",

abstract="Tabu search (TS) is a solution methodology within the area of metaheuristics. While the methodology applies to optimization problems in general, most TS applications have been and continue to be in discrete optimization. A key and distinguishing feature of tabu search is the use of special strategies based on adaptive memory. The underlying philosophy is that an effective search for optimal solutions should involve a flexible process that responds to the objective function landscape in a manner that allows it to learn appropriate directions to exploit specific areas of the solution space and useful departures to explore new terrain. The adaptive memory structures of tabu search enable the implementation of procedures that are capable of searching effectively and produce solutions of suitable quality within reasonable computational effort.",
